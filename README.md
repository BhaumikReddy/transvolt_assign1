# Assignment - 1

I have converted my Jupyter Notebook into a Flask-based web app that displays all charts in one place.  
The notebook is executed and rendered into HTML, and Flask serves it as a simple website.

## Deployment
The app is deployed on **PythonAnywhere**.  
You can view it live here: [bhaumikreddy.pythonanywhere.com](https://bhaumikreddy.pythonanywhere.com)
